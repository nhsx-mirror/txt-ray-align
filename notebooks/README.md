## Notebooks

This folder contains exploration `.ipynb` files associated with the report produced during Sarah Hickman's internship project.  The report can be found [here](../report/TxtRayAlign_Report2_SH.pdf).

The scripts rely on outputs from the pipelines, such as embeddings learnt by the model, CheXpert labelled sentences, or generated passages - this should be clear from the context in each notebook.

The `IU_dataset` notebooks work using data from the Indiana University Chest X-ray dataset which is available from:
- Images, <https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/collections/NLMCXR_png.tgz>
- Reports, <https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/collections/NLMCXR_reports.tgz>
or via the API.
